# The Start of My Game Project

The very beginning of a game I'm developing using Phaser 3. You can move to the left to the right and explode into multiple copies, in a push of a button. 

Controls:

Hold "A" to move left.
Press "D" to move right.
Tap "P" rapidly for your special move.

# How it's made:

  First I had to create an environment for my game giving it functions like gravity and velocity. Then start insterting images to display things like, characters, backgrounds, etc. Once everything is set I started working on moving my characters.
  
  # Lessons Learned:
  
  Tools: Phaser, JavaScript
  
  When making a game, you have to host it. I was having the hardest time getting this to display in my browser at first. I gave in and asked a buddy of mine for a quick set of eyes, and he instantly handed me the solution that was right under my nose. Host your games guys.
